TASK 2
SECURITY ALERT
MONITORING & INCIDENT
RESPONSE

#Introduction
In this activity, we were tasked with monitoring and analyzing security logs with Splunk, an
open-source SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) software. The main objective
was to create, gather, and log system and authentication logs so that we could identify events
like failed login, brute force attempts, unauthorized access, and web application errors.
Splunk allows security experts to consume huge amounts of raw log data and convert it into
useful information through queries, dashboards, and visualizations. Splunk makes it possible to
identify abnormal patterns that would otherwise remain undetected by indexing and correlating
disparate log sources.
●​ In a typical enterprise environment, SIEM solutions such as Splunk are important in:
●​ Threat Detection: Alerting for malicious activities such as brute force attacks or unusual
user logins.
●​ Incident Response: Delighting investigators with actionable intelligence to back-trace the
attack timeline.
●​ Compliance Monitoring: Assuring compliance with rules and regulations by keeping and
processing logs.
●​ Operational Visibility: Providing administrators with a single pane of glass to observe
system health and security stance.
●​ Proactive Defense: Allowing for alerts and automated responses to be configured to
block threats before they grow.
This practice exposed us to how SIEMs are set up, how log data is consumed, and how various
types of security incidents can be simulated and monitored. By actually completing each step by
hand, not only did we get practice with Splunk as a tool, but we also solidified our knowledge of
how attackers leave a footprint in logs and how defenders can use them for defense.

#Environment Setup
1.​ Operating System: Kali Linux
2.​ Tool Installed: Splunk Enterprise (10.0.0, Linux 64-bit)
3.​ Logs Collected:
a.​ Authentication logs (SSH login attempts)
b.​ System logs (journal logs)
4.​ Browser Used for Splunk Web: Firefox (http://127.0.0.1:8000)

#Installation of Splunk
Step 1: Download Splunk
1.​ Go to Splunk Downloads
2.​ Sign up / log in with a free Splunk account.
3.​ Download the Linux .deb package (choose the 64-bit .deb version).
Step 2: Install Splunk (Terminal)
1.​ cd ~/Downloads
2.​ sudo dpkg -i splunk-10.0.0-e8eb0c4654f8-linux-amd64.deb
Step 3: Start Splunk
1.​ cd /opt/splunk/bin
2.​ sudo ./splunk start --accept-license
Step 4: Access Splunk
1.​ http://127.0.0.1:8000
​

#Generating Logs
Authentication Logs (SSH)
1.​ Installed SSH server:
sudo apt install -y openssh-server​
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
2. Created failed login attempts (simulating brute force):
for i in {1..5}; do ssh wronguser@127.0.0.1 -o ConnectTimeout=2 || true; done
3. Created a successful login:
ssh kali@127.0.0.1​
exit
4. Exported SSH-related logs:
sudo journalctl -u ssh --no-pager > ~/future_interns/logs/auth.log​
sudo journalctl -b --no-pager > ~/future_interns/logs/syslog.log

#Uploading Logs to Splunk
1.​ Opened Splunk Web → Settings → Add Data → Upload.
2.​ Uploaded auth.log, syslog.log.
​
#Assigned Source Types:
a.​ syslog → auth.log and syslog.log
​
#Indexed all logs under main.
​
#Analyzing Logs in Splunk
1.​ Show all events
index=main | head 20
​
2.​ Detect Failed SSH Logins
index=main "Failed password" OR "authentication failure"
​
#Remediation Recommendations
1.​ Enforce robust passwords & account lockout policies.
2.​ Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
3.​ Limit SSH to allowed IP ranges.
4.​ Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for unauthorized request filtering.
5.​ Centralize log monitoring & enable automated alerts for repeated failures.

#Conclusion
We learned how to do the following through this exercise:
●​ Install and set up Splunk as a SIEM solution.
●​ Create and gather authentication, system, and web server logs.
●​ Employ Splunk SPL queries to identify failed logins, brute force attempts, and
unauthorized access.
●​ Develop alerts and reports to continuously monitor suspicious activity.
●​ Learn the significance of log analysis for incident detection and response.
This hands-on exercise reinforced how SIEM offerings like Splunk turn raw log data into
actionable security intelligence, which is essential for real-world threat prevention and
monitoring. Through the simulation of brute force attempts, invalid requests, and
legitimate logins, we saw how logs expose patterns that point to threats, and how
Splunk facilitates automation.
In an enterprise context, having the capability to centralize and analyze logs enables
security teams to:
●​ Identify and categorize incidents rapidly.
●​ Promptly take remediation measures prior to damage.
●​ Enhance compliance posture by maintaining extensive audit trails.
●​ Enhance the overall security maturity of the organization through incident-based
learning.
Overall, this exercise not only showcased Splunk's technical capabilities but reinforced
the general significance of log analysis within an effective overall cybersecurity
approach. It underscored how visibility, detection, and response are interdependent
pillars of a strong defense system.
