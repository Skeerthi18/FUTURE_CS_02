#Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up Splunk Enterprise on Kali Linux and use it as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool. 
The goal is to generate, collect, and analyze logs (authentication logs, system logs, and web server logs) to detect security events such as:
Failed login attempts
Brute force attacks
Unauthorized web access

#Key Learnings
1.Hands-on setup of Splunk SIEM for security monitoring.
2.How to generate and ingest logs from different sources.
3.Writing SPL queries for detecting brute force, failed logins, and unauthorized access.
4.Importance of log analysis in incident response and prevention.
